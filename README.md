# Golang To-Do Application

This repo is mainly for the purpose of starting to code in Go. It shows how folder should be structured for a production level app in a MVC format. It has 2 models:
1. User
2. TodoList
(Built in a manner that it can be extended across others as well)

It also has an .env file to take in values based on environment.

The Dockerfile is also provided to make the app dockerised and run using docker-compose file (as it helps setup a mongo instance as well).
